0) OverviewThis archive contains source data, analysis code, and original figure exports to reproduce all results from the manuscript, which uses only TCGA-BRCA RNA-seq data and public gene sets. This study is entirely computational.* No wet-lab experiments were conducted.* No blots, microscopy, IHC, or flow cytometry images were generated.* All results derive from public TCGA-BRCA transcriptomic data (RNA-seq counts and metadata).Accordingly, all “original images” required by the journal correspond to uncropped computational plots (volcano, heatmaps, PCA, SHAP, violin, lollipop).1. Data Sources* Raw RNA-seq counts: 1.TCGA_BRCA_STAR_Counts_raw_file.csv* Metadata (tumor vs normal): 1.TCGA_BRCA_Metadata_Final.csv* Normalized expression matrix (VST): 3.BRCA_VST_Normalized_Matrix.csvSource: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-BRCA) via Genomic Data Commons (GDC).Cohort: 1,111 primary tumors, 113 normal tissues.Ethics: TCGA data are publicly available; no additional ethics approval required.2.

P).* Related Figures: Fig. 4 (Venn overlap), heatmaps of significant genes.Step 6 — Machine Learning (4-Gene Panel)* Primary notebook: 6.BRCA_4_genes_ML.ipynb* Supplementary: 7&8.Feature_importance_models.ipynb, 7&8.SHAP and LASSO-Coef.ipynb* Models: RF, SVM, XGB, AdaBoost, GBM, KNN, Logistic, Tree, Naive Bayes, ANN, LASSO.* Oversampling: SMOTE.* Outputs: performance metrics (Accuracy, AUC, F1, etc.).* Related Figures: Fig. 5A–E, Fig. 7.Step 7 — SHAP Interpretability* Folder: 8.SHAP/* Notebook: 7&8.SHAP and LASSO-Coef.ipynb* Outputs: beeswarm, waterfall, mean SHAP plots.* Related Figures: Fig. 5A–C.Step 8 — PCA & Expression Visualization* Notebook: 9.Plots.ipynb* Outputs:o PCA on 4-gene panel (Fig. 5F, Fig. 6)o Violin plots (Fig. 5G)Step 9 — Immune Infiltration (xCell)* Script: 10.Immune_Infiltration_Analysis.R* Notebook: 10.BRCA_xCell_Correlation_plots.ipynb* Outputs: Spearman correlations between gene expression and 64 xCell immune/stromal scores.* Related Figures: Fig. 8.3. Figures (Uncropped Originals)All plots used in the manuscript are exported directly from R/Python and provided separately (PNG/TIFF):* Volcano plot, heatmaps, PCA plots, violin plots.* SHAP plots, accuracy curves, ML heatmap.* Venn diagram, immune lollipop plots.4. Ethics Statement* This study exclusively used public TCGA-BRCA data.* No patient recruitment, intervention, or tissue analysis was performed.* Ethics approval is not applicable, consistent with TCGA data-use policy.5. How to Reproduce1. Open R. Run scripts in order: 1.* - 2.* - 3.* - 4.* - 5.* - 10.*.2. Open Python. Run notebooks: 6.* - 7&8.* - 9.*.3.
